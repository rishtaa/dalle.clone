"AI image generators, like DALLÂ·E, use deep learning models to transform textual input into images by learning intricate patterns and features from extensive datasets during training. These models leverage techniques such as variational autoencoders and transformers to generate diverse and realistic visual outputs based on the provided textual descriptions."
